# BACKGROUND
There’s a Supermarket in US, lets say the name is PW Mart (fictional). They sell many products ranging from meats, fishs, fruits, sweets, liquors, even golds. They have severall channel of purchase. People can come through an offline store, web store, or catalog store. They also have membership for their customers. This way, they can record some personal data of customers.

Usually, Supermarket run campaigns to boost their sales and keep their customers engaged. Supermarket usually do a season / theme based campaign. They usually integrate discounted items into a campaign to highlight the concept of the campaign.

Over the last year, PW Mart held a series of campaign. They already run the campaign 6 times. They can’t really tell wheter the campaign is working well or not. They just run the campaign as it should be run. They already record the customers data based on their demographic, purchasing behavior, and participation in the campaign from their membership data for further analysis.

PW Mart feel that their campaign is running on auto-pilot. The participant seems stagnant and only catch small percentage of their total customers. They want to run the next campaign with more tailored strategy based on experience data.

Supermarket Campaign Team, the one in Marketing Division of PW Mart, they hire a Data Analyst to help them analyze the data they already gather for the last 2 years and design the base of their next campaign.
