# BACKGROUND
There’s a Supermarket in US, lets say the name is PW Mart (fictional). They sell many products ranging from meats, fishs, fruits, sweets, liquors, even golds. They have severall channel of purchase. People can come through an offline store, web store, or catalog store. They also have membership for their customers. This way, they can record some personal data of customers.

Usually, Supermarket run campaigns to boost their sales and keep their customers engaged. Supermarket usually do a season / theme based campaign. They usually integrate discounted items into a campaign to highlight the concept of the campaign.

Over the last year, PW Mart held a series of campaign. They already run the campaign 6 times. They can’t really tell wheter the campaign is working well or not. They just run the campaign as it should be run. They already record the customers data based on their demographic, purchasing behavior, and participation in the campaign from their membership data for further analysis.

PW Mart feel that their campaign is running on auto-pilot. The participant seems stagnant and only catch small percentage of their total customers. They want to run the next campaign with more tailored strategy based on experience data.

Supermarket Campaign Team, the one in Marketing Division of PW Mart, they hire a Data Analyst to help them analyze the data they already gather for the last 2 years and design the base of their next campaign.
# PROBLEM
Let’s see what might be our problem first based on the given data.
![q1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/049d6ef8-3955-4b8e-9659-090771bcfef2)

As you can see, the campaign participation is so low. only 1 out of 5 people has participated, more over the participation rate is only 1.2x, which means most of the participant only participated 1 time during the 4 campaign. If you look at participation per campaign, it’s only 1 out of 13 people participated in each campaign.
# OBJECTIVE
To best formulate next campaign, we should should evaluate our campaign performance and compared to our data as general. By then, we might conclude and answer these key questions that shape a campaign:

1. Based on experience, evaluate campaign participations!
2. Based on demographics, what’s the best target audience?
3. Based on experience, is discount needed?
4. If needed, which products that should be discounted?
5. What channel of purchase should we integrate more in the campaign?
# ABOUT DATASET
# DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING
# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
## 1. Demographic Analysis
I evaluate how the participation in each campaign and overall. I calculate:
* Proportion of the participation per demography
* Proportion of participation in whole campaigns
* Rate of participation per demography
* Rate of participation in whole campaigns
* Proportion of population per demography
* Discount analysis per demography and overall
* Channel of purchase per demography and overall
## 2. Using RFM for Customer Segmentation

# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
We already know which demography classes is the best for audience targeting and how the last 5 campaigns went. We can conclude and recommend the PW Mart Marketing / Campaign Team to:

By making audience priority:

* Lower Middle Class (75%)
* Family (72%)
* Couple — Married (39%) and Together (26%) = (65%)
* Graduation (50%)
* Gen X (48%)
  
Integrates discount to campaign with items that meet the needs of top demography.

Boost campaign in Store. If budget is good, also boost on Web.

## Recommendation

### Target Audience
My main audience should be the **Lower Middle Class** with families (kids/teens at home). We can also include other demographic types like couples (Married and Together), Graduates, and Millennials to enhance our campaign.

### Discount Strategy
The discounted items should meet the needs of our primary audience, especially the **Lower Middle Class** with families (kids/teens at home).

### Channel Strategy
We should boost our campaign primarily in-store, then consider boosting it on our website as our secondary channel of purchase if budget permits.

### RFM-Based Actions
* At Risk: Offer personalized discounts and send surveys to understand and resolve potential dissatisfaction. Focus on re-engagement to prevent customer loss.
* Need Attention: Send targeted offers on fast-moving products and timely promotions to encourage quicker repeat purchases.
* Potential Loyalists: Strengthen their connection with exclusive offers (e.g., free shipping) and personalized care to convert them into loyal customers.
